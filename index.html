				<h1>Hi have you heard of the Juno Probe. Recent Juno has finally entered orbit with Jupiter.</h1>

				<p>After five years hurtling through space, NASA's Juno probe  slipped into orbit around Jupiter, the biggest, oldest planet in our cosmic neighborhood, on the Fourth of July. As the world awoke Tuesday, scientists were abuzz with the possibility that the basketball-court-size spacecraft would help us understand how our solar system and all its planets and even life itself came to be.

				<br>
				The orbiter was traveling some 125,000 mph as it closed in on the king of the planets. It was aiming for an area of space just a few miles wide, trying to hit that target within the span of a few seconds. If it missed, the probe might have zipped right past Jupiter, burned up in the gas giant's atmosphere or set itself on an orbital trajectory where the planet's intense radiation would destroy the spacecraft's instruments.</p>
